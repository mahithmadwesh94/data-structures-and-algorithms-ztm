// Every child belongs to a parent who has a higher priority or value
// max heap => where parent node is highest compared to children
//  min heap => where parent node is the least compared to children
// lookup O(n)
// insert and delete O(log N)
// left to right and then bubbles up
// priority queues
// Trie - O(length of the word). Good with space complexity
